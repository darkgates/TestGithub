Git commands

git status
git init  
git add *
git commit -m "file is connected"
git push origin master
git pull    

Note: git pull is used for updating local repository from Remote repository.
Note: git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an 
      existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new empty 
      repository.

Note: git commit command is used to save your changes to the localrepository. Note
      that you have to explicitly tell Git which changes you want to include in a  
      commitbefore running the "git commit" command. This means that a file won't 
      be automatically included in the next commit just because it was changed.

Note: git push origin master will push your changes to the remote server. "master" 
      refers to master branch in your repository. If you want to push your changes to 
      any other branch (say test-branch), you can do it by: git push origin test-branch. 
      This will push your code to origin of test-branch in your repository

git remote add (add the URL to that repository)
git fetch (fetch all branches from that URL to your local repository)
git checkout (create all the files of the main branch in your working tree
